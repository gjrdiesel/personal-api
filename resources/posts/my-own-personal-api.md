Building my own personal API. Exciting huh? Ya, I thought so. Why? Well, I wanted to do something different.

I'm procrastinating. See, I have a project I'm working on, but it's miserable. I'd rather do anything else,
and I'm hoping that maybe, just maybe, a little bit of hope from this side project can spark some life back into my 
regular project.

I could be applying for new jobs, building a better resume, or actually blogging some of the more useful articles I wanna
write, but instead, I'm working on this personal API project. I'm at least hopeful that it also counts towards those other
goals.

I've had a personal website running for a bit, but it's been on netlify, and I've had a wordpress website running for a bit,
but now I'm thinking it's time to add a little laravel/graphql to the mix, and maybe I'll add some of the other endpoints
to the mix here I've wanted.

My first goal on this is to get it to pull in posts and projects from different places. Like I just started blogging to dev.to,
because my personal website was a pain. I'm hoping to pull dev.to posts and actual markdown files all in this site. So I have
the freedom to post from either. And maybe I'll expose all this via a single graphql then build a gatsby site to display it.

Guess I'll get started on the graphql part first at least.
